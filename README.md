# CS50

I attended Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science Course, known as CS50, 
and I would like to share my submissions with anyone interested in the way I solved the problem sets of the course.

## Structure

This repository is structured in the way I organized my CS50 codespace when taking the course:

- Each "Week" has it's own folder, containing the it's Lab's and Problem Set's exercises.
- No "answers.txt" file is provided to those problems sets who need them to be submited, check the [Disclaimer](#-disclaimer-) section for more information, if it isn't obvious why.
- My final project source code is [here](https://github.com/pl4g/CS50/tree/main/final-project).
- A live preview is available [here](https://plague.is-a.dev/CS50/).
