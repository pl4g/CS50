#### Description:

For my CS50's final project I decided to write a little game, and it was Conway's Game of Life, a [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) which has the following set of rules:

- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
- Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

These rules make it [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_complete) and able to simulate a [universal constructor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_universal_constructor) or any other [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine).

I wanted to start making it in the [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) engine using the LUA Language, but due to some limitations of my understanding of the engine I decided to go with Javascript, using a canvas and having a helping hand from [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), as with it I was easily able to make the grid work as well as the click in each cell.

### Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€assets                  // Folder for the images used in the project.
â”œâ”€â”€index.html              // HTML document with the structure of the page.
â”œâ”€â”€style.css               // Style Sheets to make the page prettier.
â”œâ”€â”€p5.min.js               // p5.js file used to import the libraries functions.
â””â”€â”€app.js                  // JavaScript app with the logic to the game
```

I made a simple HTML document to contain the canvas and the play button. Alongside with a CSS file to stylize the page.

I started by coding some abstraction code, such as the Game object and the GameState object, which should be used as an enum to control the current state of the game.

After, I made the Grid be on it's initial state when entering the page and then displaing it, also made the code for checking the cell being clicked and invert it's state, so the player can set the initial state of the game.

Then I spent a lot of time making the function to count the live neighbors, it was indeed the hardest logic I needed to apply in this project, after getting the logic right through lots of debugging *(console.log went wild)* I went on to make the cells behave according to the rules, it was incredibly easy, and so on I finished with a function to pause the game and another one to clear the grid.

So, with the project now complete I invite you to check it out and play around in the *pl4gue's Game of Life*.
