Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

With a small number of predictions, it's harder to accurately predict the real chances because the randomness is greater than the number of attempts.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 100 predictions.
